Predicting the MPG values through linear regression provides the following information:
  - Variable that provides non random amounts of variance are:
      - based on the results from the regression analysis the estimated variables with the 
      non random variances are to be vehicle length, and ground clearance with their    extremeley minute p values. The smallness of the p value makes these variables statistically likely to provide non random amounts of variance.
